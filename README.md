## Introduction
Goal of the paper: Energy storage application tailored according to LV prosumers contracts in Madeira in Portugal.
System of relevance: Prosumers/Consumers with/without inelastic load and/or renewable generation in context of Madeira. Can be applicable for other networks!!

In this work we consider a prosumer with inelastic load
and rooftop solar generation as DG and an energy storage
battery. The battery serves four purposes: (i) increase self-consumption, thus reducing waste of excess generation if
any, (ii) perform energy arbitrage, (iii) minimize the peak
demand charge and (iv) maintain battery charge level for
scheduled and/or anticipated power failures.
